# Letter_Recognition---Batching
Using neural networks to recognise diferent letters by thheir pixel properties. 
Created a fill multi-layered perceptron, from scatch, which utlises the standard Gradient Descent Backpropogration algorithm. 
Incoprated the deep-learning framework, TensorFlow, in this application for its execution and accuracy in training the model.
Furthermoe, i wanted to take advantage of TensorFlow's batching capabilities, allowing for faster array operations and faster training of the model. 
The model reached a 92% accuracy.
